            <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
            <p>The Executive Committee of the Singapore Section of The Combustion Institute issues this Code of Conduct to complement the Code of Ethics adopted by the Board of Directors of The Combustion Institute.</p>
            <p>The Singapore Section of the Combustion Institute (SSCI) is committed to providing a safe environment for all its members and meeting attendees free from unlawful harassment. Harassment in any form, based on sex, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, age, disability, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), medical condition, pregnancy, or any other protected characteristics recognized by law, is a violation of the Code of Conduct.</p>
            <p>Everyone should be treated with respect without fear of discrimination, quid pro quo, or condescension whether blatant or via micro-aggressions. This policy applies to all SSCI members and covers behavior that takes place at any programs or activities associated with The Combustion Institute.</p>

            <h4>Reporting an Incident</h4>
            <p>The SSCI takes all reports of behavior prohibited by the Code of Conduct seriously. Any individual who experiences or witnesses such behavior is encouraged to report such violations to the Chairperson or the Secretary of the SSCI. Prompt reporting ensures a timely and constructive resolution.</p>
            <p>All reports will be handled with sensitivity and kept as confidential as possible to respect the privacy of all parties. Responses are initiated to stop the prohibited behavior and prevent its reoccurrence. Possible outcomes include, but are not limited to, a warning, separation of the involved persons, exclusion from current and/or future events, and revoking membership.</p>

            <h4>Retaliation</h4>
            <p>The SSCI does not tolerate any form of retaliation against an individual who files a report or assists in the resolution of a report. Retaliation is a violation of this Code of Conduct, and any instances should be reported immediately to the Chairperson or Secretary.</p>

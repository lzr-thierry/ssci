**Message from the Organizers**

Dear Esteemed Colleagues and Guests,

It is with great pleasure that we welcome you to the 15th Asia-Pacific Conference on Combustion (ASPACC 2025) in the vibrant city of Singapore. This event marks a significant moment in the dynamic field of combustion research, a pivotal area bridging energy, sustainability, and advanced technology. We gather to share insights from academia, industry, and government, reflecting the substantial progress and evolving contributions of the Asia-Pacific region to this critical discipline.

Our technical program is designed to address both the traditional elements of combustion science and the innovative approaches towards sustainable, low-carbon energy solutions. A key focus will be the integration of combustion technologies with low carbon alternative fuels, highlighting the role of hydrogen energy in this transition. Singapore's National Hydrogen Strategy, which aims to optimise hydrogen as a crucial component of the future energy landscape, aligns perfectly with our conference themes and underscores the transformative initiatives that ASPACC seeks to promote.

As we begin this exciting journey, we invite you to fully engage—participate actively in technical sessions, exchange ideas, and collaborate across disciplines and borders. Our collective expertise is vital for fostering innovation that advances combustion science and contributes to a sustainable future. Let's take this opportunity to build enduring relationships and initiate projects that will have a lasting impact on our communities and beyond.

Thank you for your dedication to excellence in combustion research and your efforts towards a sustainable future. We look forward to engaging discussions and an inspiring exchange of ideas throughout the ASPACC 2025 conference.

Warm regards,
Singapore Section of the Combustion Institute
